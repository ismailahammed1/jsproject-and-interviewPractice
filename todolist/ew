
this is the new pixel 8A in the bay color and this time around is extremely Punchy that is the Bay from the 8 Pro and check out the bay on the 8A it's definitely more saturated that's how I would describe it this aesthetic really fits in with the 8 and 8 Pro with the visor look along the top is actually feeling a little bit more premium with this metallic frame this is quite a comfortable size to hold as well I notice that the ridge is not as substantial as it is on the pro so if I hold up the pro here I can sort of fit

my finger underneath it's a much taller Ridge more camera components here more subtle so if I place it down like this now I can tell we've got more of a bezel on this unit compared to the pro model or the standard pixel 8 however it's important to remember that this is an early first look hands- on so I can't go through everything with this device 8 8 Pro and then the new 8A which as you can tell very similar in scale to the standard pixel 8 today's episode has been sponsored by ear fun and they're

affordable ANC wireless headphones that are actually going to remind you of some stuff that's a lot more expensive with the code in the description you can get these things for like 60 bucks so definitely go check that link you can see highres audio wireless audio as well 80 hours of play time on a battery hybrid active noise cancellation 40 mm drivers unboxing experience relatively elegant you can see the whole thing folds up soft headband as well as ear cups and if we look at the bottom side you can see they charge up over USBC

which is nice and that type- c Port is capable of fast charge so 5 minutes gives you 5 hours of battery life noise cancelling you got have strong ANC Comfort wind cancelling Ambient sound or normal can you talk now Mo testing testing 1 2 3 testing testing 1 2 zero louder Mo test 1 2 3 zero here you try all right go you're not talking there's no way you're talking I'm talking now I'm talking now I'm talking now for real are you actually talking talking now for real okay wow I can't hear anything

you're saying why do I talk loud like this no no way no way that was you yelling you mess with me a lot so I don't know if you're messing with me I'm not Mo oh you were yelling there oh wow these are really good Google is saying it's the most dir able a series phone that they've made yet it's IP67 protected so it's going to do better with both water and dust and the majority of the body is actually made of recycled aluminum the display on this guy 6.1 in 20 by9 aspect ratio the

resolution 2400x 1080 and it does go up to 120 HZ on the refresh it's got Gorilla Glass 3 on the front glass and always on display and it can do up to 1,400 nits of HDR brightness and up to 2,000 nits for Peak brightness briess now they're stating it's got 24-hour battery life obviously that depends on how you use your device but the actual battery inside is listed at 4492 milliamp hours and it also features fast charging and it also features wireless charging which is a nice little touch for an A series device you can get

it in either 128 or 256 storage and it has 8 gigs of RAM and of course it's also got Google's tensor G3 chip you're getting the Google one VPN built in at no extra cost and Google is saying that you're going to get 7 years of os security and feature drop updates of course this is a major advantage that Google has often new and experimental features will drop on the pixel devices first seeing as how they're the ones that develop the operating system now the other nice thing is that even though

this is Google's budget device you're getting the same chip that you get in the premium devices so you'd expect performance to be similar as well at least when it comes to processing power they give you the tensor G3 even though you're not paying as much as you were for the 8 Pro for example it does feature stereo speakers as well so it'll be tougher to cover up the sound and as far as colors go and as I mentioned earlier this is called Bay which is a little bit more saturated than the 8 Pro

Bay but there's also going to be obsidian porcelain and aloe now here's another bold statement inside of my notes that they sent over they say that the pixel 8A has the best camera under $500 so two things there that tells us the device is going to be under $500 I presume USD but it also of course tells us that they're very proud of their camera both hardware and software now let's talk a little bit more about those cameras I can't show you samples from those cameras right now but I can give

you the spec 64 megapixel quad PD wide camera it's got an F 1.89 aperture and it gives you an 80° field to view the image sensor size is 1 over 1.73 in it's also got a 13 megapixel ultrawide camera that's at f2.2 and that field of view is 120° and it's also got built-in lens correction so you don't have too much of that warping or fisheye effect and the main camera the wide camera has both Optical and electronic image stabilization on the front we have a 13 megapixel selfie camera that's a fixed

focus and it has a 96.5 de Ultra wide field of view so that that should be enough possibly fit a couple people into that selfie of course you've got all all of Google's software features inside of the camera app including magic editor best take Magic Eraser photo on blur like this list has gotten longer and longer but it is all going to be baked into the 8A when it comes to video recording you're going to be looking at 4K at 30 frames or 60 frames and even the front camera can do 4K as well at 30

frames you can do slow motion up to 240 FPS there is video stabilization built in but since this is a first look hand on video I can't test that out right now however I will and I have a little bit of confidence because I've just had such good experiences with pixel cameras in the past maybe this is the best camera under 500 we'll have to see so just handling the devices I mean this one feels incredibly similar to the pixel 8 in the past the the a series would have maybe a more plastic body or maybe the

build would be a giveaway that you were looking at a more budget model but that's not really the case anymore these two in hand feel very interchangeable and that's a good thing because people get to have a premium phone experience for under 500 bucks now obviously I've got to play with the phone a little bit more extensively but I'm pretty confident with the tensor chip in there and these bold statements about the camera performance that we're probably looking at something fairly competitive

at that particular price point it obviously comes out like months after the original many months after the original but they get you a lot of what you were getting in their premium or Flagship device at this discount although one thing I like about all the pixel models is that because the Bulge at least goes across the entire back of the phone there's no wobble here's the pro I mean maybe if you were pushing in the very top but pretty much anywhere you would tap on the phone there's no wobble they've gone for

the matte finish on the back standard pixel 8 has a glossy back on it and then it has the brushed matte section around the camera component this one has the matte finish for both matte finish on the visor bar and matte finish on the back of the device this is probably my preference it doesn't attract fingerprints really at all regardless of that you can always go ahead and slap an ultra thin later case on the brand new pixel 8 a I've actually got some of those here woo we've got lots of colors this is a development sample but these

will be ready to go coffee color I don't know about coffee with the blue however look at that if you want the thinnest case to go with your brand new pixel 88 you can definitely check out later case these will be live on the site dark blue with light blue look at this okay we can do this as well that's kind of cool we can definitely go with that so this just gives you a little bit of texture a little bit of confidence it won't slip out of your pocket as easily however interacting with the phone feels like

you have nothing on that's kind of the point with later case if you're going to pre-order the phone if you like what you see then you can also go ahead and order up the case all the details for both the phone and the cases will be down in the description the other thing to note since we don't have any power adapters in the Box anymore you can also head over to our friends at ankor because they have the easiest most portable little power bricks and bigger ones if you want more power but like look how

portable that little thing is this one's a no-brainer you're going to need a power brick anyway all right so how's that for a Hands-On in First Impressions that's everything Google told me I can do it this point I'm going to power this up and actually use it and see how it compares to the 8 Pro specifically because the 8 Pro has actually been the device in my pocket we'll see how interchangeable these two devices are and if I feel like I'm missing out on anything swapping over to this sub $500

phone what do you guys think let me know down in the comments is this a real contender in the sub $500 smartphone Wars I think it might be but you let me know
